So from what I understand, we will have two input spreadsheets. We are combining two different tables into one. This is something we could easily do with SQL but alas, we are not going to be using SQL. So for this mini-tutorial I will create two example spreadsheets.

So before we begin, we create a new standalone Google Scripts app. It needs to be standalone because we will be working with multiple files.

We can go here to create a new app and we will reach this page and can click "New Project" to create a standalone app, that is separate from any single google sheets document.
